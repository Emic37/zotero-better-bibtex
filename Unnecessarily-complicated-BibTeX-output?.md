# Unnecessarily complicated BibTeX output?

Even for titles that are just text, no math or markup involved, you will probably have noticed that Better BibTeX adds
braces left and right, causing the Bib(La)TeX processor to force-render these parts in title case even where you don't
want it to. Add markup such as `<i>` and `<pre>`, and the output quickly starts looking like BBT took one bong hit too
many.

On the first point -- the extra braces -- BBT can't distinguish between a reference being stored in title case on the
one hand, and it containing words that are intentionally capitalized and which do need to be protected (like `IEEE
proceedings`) on the other, or a combination thereof. Zotero [recommends storing references in
sentence](https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/sentence_casing) case (it's what their own citation processor expects); you
can right-click the title text to change it to sentence case. BBT exports references with that recommendation on mind,
knowing Bib(La)TeX expects title case (for English references only btw, and references without a language set are
assumed to be English by BBT).  You can steer this process somewhat by enclosing the parts you don't want case
manipulation on in `<span class="nocase">...</span>`. Anything between those won't be touched by Zotero or BBT. This is
formally supported by Zotero and will work in the Word/LibreOffice plugins as well as in the BibTeX export.

But why then the double-braces (`{{...}}`) rather than the commonly recommended single braces (`{...}`)?

This is not because of some arcane aesthetic preference, but because the Bib(La)TeX case protection rules are incredibly
convoluted ([#541](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/issues/541),
[#383](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/issues/383)). For example, here are some "interesting" cases
that BBT has learned to deal with. Did you know that

* `{\emph{Homo sapiens}}` does *not* case-protect `Homo sapiens`? It sure was a surprise to me.
* casing behavior over the *whole* reference field depends on [whether there's a slash-command at the first position](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/issues/541#issuecomment-240156274) of the title? 
* [apparently](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/issues/541#issuecomment-240999396), to make sure that `Reading HLA Hart's: <i>The Concept of Law</i>` renders as expected means I have to output the astoundingly ugly `{Reading {{HLA Hart}}'s: {{{\emph{The Concept}}}}{\emph{ of }}{{{\emph{Law}}}}}`?

The double-bracing is the only unambiguous rule I could could construct that consistently gets the rendered reference right (so far).

Bib(La)TeX provides a never-ending stream of edge cases, which BBT tries to decide algorithmically. I try to keep the resulting file as pretty as I can (I'm sensitive to the aesthetics myself), but the target is best described as "given reasonable input, generate well-rendering output", and reasonable in this case will have to include "follows Zotero recommendations for storing references".
